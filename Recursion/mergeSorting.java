    /* This code is working fine, but it needs to be optimized for that there is another file named as: mergeSortOptimized.java
       Points to be remembered for optimize it and improve its efficiency:

    ## Avoid Creating New Arrays Repeatedly:
       Creating new arrays with Arrays.copyOfRange is inefficient because it involves copying elements each
       time you call mergeSort. Instead, you can use array indices to avoid copying arrays.

    ## Use In-Place Sorting:
       If you can, try to implement in-place sorting to avoid additional space usage. For merge sort, this is more
       complex and less intuitive, but for educational purposes, itâ€™s worth noting.

    ## Optimize Merge Function:
       Your merge function is already efficient, but ensures you're not performing redundant operations.
       For instance, copying remaining elements is correctly done, but ensure your array access patterns are efficient.
